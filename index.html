    		<p>Having a healthy body is important for fighting
    		off sickness, having energy, and maintaining our
    		mental/emotional health.</p>
    		<p>While the pandemic continues, gyms and other public
    		fitness resources are closed. Without these resources,
    		we become in danger of becoming less physically healthy.
    		</p>
    		<p>Here at Pandemic Moves, you can make fitness easier,
    		with provided fitness targets for you to meet and
    		guidance on how to do yoga movements correctly.</p>
